## 🔁 Why TEPMT?

Traditional TEP workflows lack automation, traceability, and AI-native integration. TEPMT defines:

- ✅ A modular pipeline: Translate → Edit → Proof  
- ✅ Rich metadata and audit trail at each step  
- ✅ Compatibility with TMX 2.0 and JSONL formats  
- ✅ Seamless integration with CAT tools, LLMs, and enterprise systems
